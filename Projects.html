                        importance in Indian culture, heritage and tradition. Throughout history, art has played a vital

                    <h2>Green Ganesha Project</h2>
                    <p>Ganesh Chaturthi is 10 days festival marking the birth of the elephant-headed deity Ganesha, the
                        god of prosperity, knowledge, good luck and wisdom.</p>
                    <p>People celebrate this festival by bringing painted ganesh idol made of clay or Plaster of Paris
                        (POP) and perform rituals with devotion. The festival concludes with ‘Gansh visarjan’ a process
                        of immersing the idol in a river to see-off of the lord. Unfortunately, not all cities are
                        blessed with a river or sea in the proximity. Because of this various ponds lakes and other
                        water sources are used to see-off the god. Since the paint material used to colour idol contains
                        ‘lead’ this is toxic in nature. POP too gets dissolved slowly and increases the acidity of water
                        and thus water is polluted when idol is immersed. This adversely affects the environment,
                        pollutes water bodies and ecosystem as there have been reports of dead fish and reduction of
                        aquatic flora and fauna in the water source where idols are immersed.</p>
                    <p>Project green ganesha is an environment friendly initiative to save ecosystem in which ganesh
                        idols are made of natural clay provided by government of Gujarat and idol is painted using
                        natural colours. Under this project workshops and seminars are conducted at various urban and
                        rural areas and also in various corporates, organizations, collages etc. in which team of
                        trained artist and experts working in the field of idol making teaches how to make eco- friendly
                        idol with the objective of spreading the message of environment conservation, supporting local
                        artists and avoiding the use of POP idols.</p>
                    <p>This innovative project also involves the practice of gift economy and financially support the
                        local artists and encourage their art and also the monetary contribution from this project will
                        help in education and skill development project i.e., Tiny Library in which library will be made
                        in tribal areas which will include books, computer lab, seminar room, smart class room, open air
                        theater etc. so that tribal children can get excess smart education system by the use of
                        technology.</p>

                        harnessed in cloudy weather. By harnessing the power of the sun, we can generate clean
                        electricity without depleting finite resources or contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
                        Solar technology converts sunlight into electrical energy either through photovoltaic panels or
                        through mirrors the concentrates solar radiation. Solar products like solar air conditioning,
                        solar cell phone charger, solar chimney, solar calculator, solar cooker, solar dryer etc.
                        utilize this sustainable energy source, reducing our reliance on non-renewable fossil fuels and

                        use of non-renewable sources of energy and also reduce the expense like light bill, gas bill
                        etc. if they start using solar light and solar cooker for cooking food.</p>
